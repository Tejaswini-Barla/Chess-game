# Chess-game
🚀 Features in This Code
✅ Chessboard with alternating colors
✅ Pieces initialized (Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Pawn)
✅ Click-based movement
✅ Turn-based play (White starts first)

🛠️ Next Steps (Enhancements)
🔹 Restrict movement to valid chess moves
🔹 Check & Checkmate detection
🔹 Drag & Drop support
🔹 AI opponent (Minimax algorithm)

Would you like me to add move validation or any other feature? 😊♟️

📌 Description of Chess Game in Java
The Chess Game implemented in Java is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application using Java Swing. It allows two players to play a turn-based game of chess on an 8x8 board. The program initializes the chessboard, places the pieces, and allows users to move them by clicking.

🛠 Features of the Java Chess Game
✅ Basic Features
Graphical Chessboard – The board is displayed using a JPanel with an 8×8 grid of JButton squares.

Piece Initialization – Pieces are placed correctly at the start (Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Pawns).

Turn-based Gameplay – Players alternate turns, starting with White.

Piece Movement – Players can select a piece and move it to another square.

Click-based Selection – Click a piece to select it, then click another square to move it.

📌 How the Code Works
1️⃣ Setting Up the Board
The chessboard is an 8x8 grid of JButton elements.

Each button represents a square on the chessboard.

The background color follows a checkerboard pattern (White & Gray).

2️⃣ Initializing the Chess Pieces
Pieces are represented as text labels ("WP" for White Pawn, "BQ" for Black Queen, etc.).

The top two rows contain Black pieces, while the bottom two rows contain White pieces.

3️⃣ Handling Piece Selection & Movement
When a piece is clicked, it gets highlighted (yellow background).

When a destination square is clicked, the piece moves there (if valid).

After each move, the turn switches between White and Black.

4️⃣ Managing Game State
The program keeps track of turns (White or Black).

It ensures only the current player’s pieces can move.

📌 Limitations & Future Enhancements
🚧 Limitations in Current Version
❌ No Move Validation – Pieces can move anywhere (No restrictions based on chess rules).
❌ No Check/Checkmate Detection – The game does not track if a king is in check.
❌ No Drag & Drop Support – Only click-based movement is implemented.
❌ No AI Opponent – The game is designed for two players only.

🔥 Future Enhancements
🔹 Implement legal move validation based on piece movement rules.
🔹 Add Check & Checkmate detection.
🔹 Introduce Drag & Drop functionality for smoother interaction.
🔹 Develop a Computer AI opponent using the Minimax Algorithm.
🔹 Enable Undo/Redo functionality to revert moves.
🔹 Support Online Multiplayer using Java Sockets.

📌 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java

GUI Framework: Java Swing

Data Structures: 2D array for board representation

Event Handling: ActionListener for button clicks
